## **Summary**
Analyzing temperatures in Hawaii utilizing June and December weather data to determine if a surf and ice cream shop can potentially remain profitable year round.
## Results
The staff first reviewed June temperatures:
![June Temps](https://github.com/darmando1/surfs_up/blob/main/Challenge/JuneTemps.JPG)

The staff notes an average temperature of 74.94 degrees with a low of 64 degrees and a high of 85 degrees.

The staff next reviewed December temperatures:
![December Temps](https://github.com/darmando1/surfs_up/blob/main/Challenge/DecemberTemps.JPG)

The staff notes an average temperature of 71.04 degrees, a low of 56 degrees and a high of 83 degrees.

Differences:
  - December is slightly colder than June on average (approximately 3 degree difference.)
  - The lows can get relatively chilly in December compared to in June (8 degree difference.)
  - The highs appear to be relatively similar in June and December (85 vs 83 degrees.)

## Conclusion
The staff concludes the following queries and poses the following questions:
  - Another query that could be included was the previous query identifying precipitation. Are more people likely to eat ice cream when it's sunny versus when it's raining?
  - Continuing the above train of thought, one could also include some sort of time identifier. Due to the December temperatures dropping to a potential low of 56 degrees, when do these drops usually occur? One would assume the drop in temperature occurs at night, stays low during the morning and gradually raises during the day. Do people usually buy ice cream late at night (after going out for dinner?) Does the temperature drop relatively early (8pm - 10pm) or do the significant drops occur later in the night (10pm+). Will the temperature drops affect the business if the operating hours are not within the time the temperatures drop?
  - Overall it appears that within Hawaii a surf and ice cream shop can remain profitable throughout the year. Mainly due to the minimal discrepancies between June and JAnuary temperatures. Nonetheless, there are many questions that still require answers and thus the staff recommends further analysis with more data points.
